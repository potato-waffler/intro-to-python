# Here's a mindbender for you:

a = 10
b = 20
a = b
print(f"a is {a}")
print(f"b is {b}")

# @TASK: What does that output? And why? Take a guess, then
# run the code and see.

# Was it what you expected?
# Yes, while a is intialially assigned 10, the statement a = b changes that value to that of b which is 20. 

# Try to puzzle it out, and then move on to
# 020_state_tables.py
